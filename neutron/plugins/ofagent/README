# -- Notes for updating from Icehouce

The support of ancillary bridges has been removed after Icehouce.
While you can still use these bridges to provide connectivity,
neutron-ofagent-agent no longer reports port state changes (up/down)
for these bridges.  If it is a problem for you, please consider
tweaking your configuration to avoid using ancillary bridges.
We recommend to use a provider network instead as the following:

- Make l3-agent external_network_bridge configuration empty.
  eg.
    [DEFAULT]
    external_network_bridge=

- (Re-)create a network (and subnet) for public connectivity with
  a flat provider network.
  eg.
    neutron net-create $PUBLIC_NETWORK -- \
      --router:external=True \
      --provider:network_type:flat \
      --provider:physical_network=$PUBLIC_PHYSICAL_NETWORK

- Associate your neutron router to the above network.
  eg.
    neutron router-gateway-clear $ROUTER_ID
    neutron router-gateway-set $ROUTER_ID $PUBLIC_NETWORK

- Add the corresponding entry to bridge_mappings.
  eg.
    [OVS]
    bridge_mappings=$PUBLIC_PHYSICAL_NETWORK:$PUBLIC_BRIDGE
